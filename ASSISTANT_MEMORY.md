- `dot_gitignore` - Global Git ignore patterns
- `dot_zsh_keybindings` - Terminal key binding configuration
- `dot_zshenv` - Zsh environment variables
- `dot_zshrc` - Main shell configuration

Recent commits:
- "nvm" - Simplified NVM loading (removed lazy loading)
- "simplify" - Streamlined configurations
- "updates" - Various updates
- "starship" - Implementation of Starship prompt 

## Initial Assessment (April 9, 2025)

The repository initially contained a collection of dotfiles:
- `dot_bash_profile`, `dot_bashrc` (minimal bash configs) - [Now removed]
- `dot_zshrc` (primary shell config)
- `dot_zsh_prompt` (custom prompt configuration) - [Now replaced with Starship]
- `dot_functions` (shell utility functions)
- `dot_gitconfig` (git aliases and settings) - [Now templated]
- `dot_gitignore` (global git ignore patterns)
- `dot_zshenv` (zsh environment variables)

The user indicated these were borrowed from another source and needed modernization.

## Modernization Actions Taken

### 1. Created Documentation

- Created `CLAUDE.md` with guidelines for Claude Code working with the repo
- Created `README.md` with installation/usage instructions

### 2. Shell Prompt Modernization

- Replaced custom `dot_zsh_prompt` with Starship prompt
- Added `dot_config/starship.toml` with user-preferred styling
- Updated `dot_zshrc` to initialize Starship

### 3. Git Configuration Updates

- Modernized `dot_gitconfig`, removing outdated settings
- Replaced URL shorthands with documentation on GitHub CLI
- Implemented templating for sensitive user information
- Created `dot_gitconfig.tmpl` and `chezmoi.toml.example` for secure info handling

### 4. ZSH Configuration Improvements

- Modernized `dot_zshrc`:
  - Used Zsh's path array for cleaner PATH management
  - Added missing history configuration
  - Added caching for completion system
  - Improved conditional checks throughout
  - Integrated Atuin for history management
  - Direct loading of NVM (previously was lazy-loaded)
  
- Created `dot_zsh_keybindings` for explicit key binding configuration:
  - Emacs-mode keybindings for familiarity
  - Word navigation with Alt/Ctrl+arrows
  - Multiple implementations of Alt+Backspace
  - Home/End navigation
  - Ctrl+W for backward word deletion

### 5. Security Improvements

- Implemented template-based handling of sensitive data
- Created example config without real user information
- Updated documentation to explain secure workflow

## Technology Stack

- **Shell**: Zsh with modern options
- **Prompt**: Starship (https://starship.rs/)
- **History**: Atuin (https://atuin.sh/) 
- **Dotfile Management**: Chezmoi (https://www.chezmoi.io/)
- **Node Version Manager**: NVM (direct loading)
- **Essential Tools**: LLVM, Homebrew, Pixi
- **Optional Utilities**: Various utilities through Homebrew

## Key Features

- Modern, well-commented configurations
- Documentation for all components
- Proper separation of sensitive information
- Integration with modern tools (Starship, Atuin)
- Explicitly defined key bindings

The user indicated they were satisfied with:
- Starship prompt replacing custom prompt
- Modern key bindings, especially Alt+Backspace for word deletion
- Git configuration cleanup
- Templating for sensitive information

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for future enhancement:
1. Consider adding shell plugins (zsh-autosuggestions, zsh-syntax-highlighting)
2. Evaluate direnv for directory-specific environment variables
3. Add more sophisticated Git hooks or aliases
4. Create machine-specific configurations via Chezmoi
5. Build more comprehensive test/installation scripts

## Decisions Explained

1. **Starship vs Custom Prompt**: Chose Starship for better maintainability, features, and performance
2. **Emacs vs Vi Mode**: Defaulted to Emacs mode for more familiar key bindings to most users
3. **Atuin Integration**: Added for superior history search and sync capabilities
4. **Git Template**: Implemented to avoid exposing personal information in public repository
5. **NVM Loading**: Initially implemented lazy loading but later simplified to direct loading
